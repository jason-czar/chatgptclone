# ChatGPT Clone

A simple ChatGPT clone built with React.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
4. For production, set environment variables on your hosting platform

## Security Notes

- Keep your API key secret
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- In production, use a secure backend service
